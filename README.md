<!--
I've built a visit tracker that counts the amount of times the website has been visited.
To use it, you go to the worker website https://visit-counter.antonanalt.workers.dev/ to check the amount of times it has been visited.
It also tracks the amount of times my resume website ant-resume.pages.dev has been visited.
Unfortunately, there is a bug in the tracker website where when you refresh it, it adds the count by 2 and it displays the sum of times visited in both the resume and tracker website. The Resume website adds 1 to the tracker.
